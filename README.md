## Introduction

This repository is a personal collection of automation frameworks that I am exploring. It contains code samples, test scripts, and configuration files for each framework. I will continue to update this repository as I learn new frameworks and techniques.

## Frameworks

### Cypress

Cypress is a front-end testing tool built for the modern web. It is known for its ease of use, fast performance, and ability to write tests quickly.
